   <p>The root folder is the original folder that has all the files for you project, then inside your root folder are other folders that hold files depenting on how you want to organize everything. When creating a website you need to use the root/folder/file for the url path. </p>
<p>The default document is always index.html under the root folder.</p>
<p>absolute link is a link outside of your website relative is a link to something in your project files. you would use relative becuase it has less code.</p>
