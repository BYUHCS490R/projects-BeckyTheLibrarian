    <p>As we diligently seek <span class="italic">to have charity and virtue</span> fill our lives, our confidence in approaching God will increase. I invite you to take intentional steps to grow in your confidence before the Lord.

We will begin to experience spiritual power that exceeds our greatest hopes.</p>
