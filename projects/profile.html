<blockquote>Moroni fortified every Nephite city with embankments, forts, and walls. When the Lamanites came against them, they “were astonished exceedingly, because of the wisdom of the Nephites in preparing their places of security.”

Similarly, <strong> turmoil rages around us, we need to create places where we are safe, both physically and spiritually.</strong> When your home becomes a personal sanctuary of faith—where the Spirit resides—your home becomes the first line of defense.
